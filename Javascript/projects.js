					JScene is a cross-platform application engine, writting in C++, using the open source library SDL2 that I originally started as <i>Window.h</i> in my 
					project, Lelantos. It is also the second verion of itself, the first version was originally paired with a game engine but I restructured 
					it with the other parts of the engine in JCode JNetwork and haven't offically decided to include the game engine with it. It works with Linux, 
					Windows 10, Android, and iOS. 
				</p>
				<p>	
					SDL2 handles most of the low level access and abstraction of devices, peripherals, and general 2D rendering. JScene optimizes SDL2's API to streamline 
					applications across devices. This includes but isn't limited to creating and starting the an application; Updating the screen - frame-by-frame handling;
					Writing text; Keyboard/Touchscreen usage; Drawing and handling images, buttons, text boxes; Audio and video. 
					Updating the new documention hasn't been done yet but you can click <a href="Legacy/JSceneV1Docs/index.html">here</a> and read the documentation for version
					1 of it to get an idea of it; There's a lot missing comparatively but it also includes the game engine I made with it.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Here's a simple example program I made using it below with the relevant code. One is a screen recording from my computer and the other is a video 
					of my Samsung Note 4 running the program; Both stitched into a GIF.

				<p>
					JCrypt is an cryptography API I made for encrypting/decrypting data with various modern or simple (a)symmetric cryptographic functions. It uses GMP for
					large number calculation for it's classical algorithms(RSA/DH). Recently I started implementing post-quantum algorithms like Supersingular Isogeny Diffie-Hellman 
					and Falcon. Argon2, which won the recent password hashing competition, has also been integrated into the library.  
					Like the rest of the library, it's cross platform compatible with Linux, Windows 10, Android, iOS. Parts of the library have been rewritten to work with 
					Arduino ESP8266/32; This includes all ECC curves and post-quantum algorithms. 
				</p>
				<p>
					For simple encryptions it has reverse, rotate right, rotate left, Ceasear cipher, and Vignere cipher.
				</p>
				<p>
					For modern encryptions, JCrypt can encrypt and decrypt using both AES 128/192/256 and Serpent. AES has both a software and hardware implementation using the AES-NI 
					instruction set for modern x86 processors which <i>significantly</i> improves performance.
				</p>
				<p>
					For modern key exchange encryption, JCrypt can use both RSA, Diffie-Hellman, and ECC standards. ECC can use the curves: P192, P224, P256, P384, P521, W25519, W448, Curve25519, Curve448, Edwards25519, Edwards448, E448, SECP192K1, SECP224K1, 
					SECP256K1, SECP192R1, SECP224R1, SECP256R1, SECP384R1, SECP521R1.

					JNetwork is a networking API that I made as part of JCode to handle all of the networking done with the projects I make. It's broken down into a few different parts so 
					that I can quickly create simple applications or easily implement other types of socket communication like bluetooth, which I intended to implement later.
				</p>
				<p>
					<span style="color:var(--text-color-orange)">JSocket</span> resides within the Network namespace and contains all the handling for socket implementation. TCP and broadcast 
					socket types are currently usable implementations. For all types of socket communication, sending, recveiving, and broadcating data are available. Data handled via typical 
					methods e.g. blocked and timed or through polling. Additionally I've added other LAN functions for getting IP addresses/interfaces and port scanning. Port scanning has been 
					implemented in 2 ways - One normal, timeout based scanning and a TCP-SYN scan similiar to nmap which is considerably faster but requires admin privileges.
				</p>
				<p>
					<span style="color:var(--text-color-orange)">JClient and JServer</span> are TCP implementations using JSocket with function hooks for additional implemetation on top of 
					each. For clients it handles safely connecting, disconnecting, sending/receiving data. For servers it handles safely starting, closing, restarting, sending/receiving data 
					and setting passwords.
				</p>
				<p>
					<span style="color:var(--text-color-orange)">JSecure</span> is a higher level implementation using <a onclick="Load_JCrypt()">JCrypt</a> and JSocket(Client/Server). Using 
					the hooks as described in JClient/JServer it combines the two API to connect and communicate securely.

			<div id="ProjectInfo">
				<p>
					JNetwork is a network application interface written C++ to try and make easier most of the communication when trying to integrate sockets in an application.
					This includes things like password locked servers to prevent unwanted connections and additional levels of security when attempting communication. Currently it has reverse, caesar, and vignere ciphers functional and 
					can be arranged in many way. I have plans for implementing RSA and Diffie-Hellman for key exchanges and AES for additional security very soon. They'll be implemented 
					once prime number generation is improved in JNumbers. Longer term planning for JNetwork would include bluetooth support.

					JCam is a WiFi security camera that uses post-quantum encryption to establish secure connections before streaming. This includes 2 types of 
					cameras; Arduino(ESP8266/32) cameras and any device that supports USB cameras. The project is built on top of my JCode library so the cameras 
					can be connected to from pretty much any device (Android/iOS/Windows/Linux). It is an ongoing project and I hope to sell them in the future.
					I'm still implementing more algorithms into <a onclick="LinkTo_JCrypt()">JCrypt</a> but currently the cameras can use: Elliptic-curve Diffie-Hellman or Superisogeny 
					Diffie-Helllman for key exchanging, Falcon for verifying signatures, and AES for encrypting the camera's stream.
				</p>
				<p>
					To work around the need for a certificate authority or having to enter a public key to the app, each connection uses the password to generate 
					and validate signatures to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. You can watch my demonstration and in depth explanation

				As the name implies this project is Snake - but made using JCode as the engine. It's the first game that I've made using it. The app is just regular Snake but I added 2 features. 
				The first feature is custom colors; In the settings you can choose the colors for the color of the app's background, the text, the game's background, and the snake. The color for each 
				can be changed with a HSL color picker I implemented. I got the idea 
				for this from my girlfriend which is why I chose this as the first game application for JCode. The second feature is multiplayer; This feature is only really usable on PC because 
				neworking/threading doesn't function as well on android using JNetwork with large sets of communication; At least with my Samsung Note 4 dispite using mostly poll based sockets. As 
				far as functionality with multiplayer goes, I was able to play a game on localhost running both clients. What does work on PC <i>and</i> mobile I game scanning - Since the app isn't run on a  
				server connecting to each other is done over LAN, so if someone is hosting a game on your network the app will scan for it. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I don't have any plans for updates in the future. I do plan on releasing it on the Google Play Store and App Store with multiplayer disabled right after I finish and host this website. I'll

					RPS Simulator is my favorite application that I've programmed so far! It's a simulation that spawns an equal number of rock, paper, and scissors in random positions 
					that actively seek eath other out. When they collide the losing object (like in regular RPS) turns into the losing one. 
					All credits for the core idea of this app go to <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@livingrps/video/6930019547961412869">this</a> TikTok. 
					The app needs to be optimized a lot but it works very well for casual usage. I plan to add a few more features to the app like 
					<a href="https://bigbangtheory.fandom.com/wiki/Rock,_Paper,_Scissors,_Lizard,_Spock">rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock</a> or 
					custom simulation conditions. Sometimes it, or at least it did at one point, results in an actual winner at larger values. My computer could handle team sizes of in the 
					hundreds of thousands but as since it's unoptimized it <i>struggles</i> to produce a winner even at values 800 or so due to the screen bounds causing more overlap.

					I at least attemped to provide templates for the objects in it. The HTML versions are essentially the same as the C++ since updates stopped very early on, so checking those 
					out are about the same. I am fairly proud of myself for the combo system that exists in the updated version; You can see the players combos by pressing the escape key. 
					Somewhere in the code exists a really simple disabled AI but it's an old project that I don't have much interest in fixing anything anytime soon. If you check either of

					Aura is an AI that I made to perform tasks for me on my computer using my voice on Windows. By the time I finished Aura the commands themselves worked fairly 
					well but I hit a roadblock of sorts between the microphone I was using and the settings for mic adjustment so commands don't always run as efficiently as they 
					should. Recompiling Aura so I could take a video was fairly difficult but everything worked well enough to demonstrate. The only command that didn't work 100% 
					was clicking links on a page; The tool and the code I used to pick links on a page ran but refused to open them and I don't want to debug it right now. The 
					other still-functional commands included searching Google/Youtube, selecting windows, videos - fullscreen/pause/play, and locking the computer. I will definitely 
					be updating Aura in the future, perhaps repurposed as a different application.

					This project I made is <i>very</i> underdeveloped but I'm adding it to the list because it might be relevant with future project of mine. The 
					project currently consists of an old slider phone (Samsung M920) that I wanted to turn into a wireless keyboard/controller. It wouldn't be as 
					underdeveloped as it is if the phone wasn't running Android 2.1. I easily spent at least 100 hours just getting the application to compile 
					for the phone. Even after creating a template that would work for it, the phone will only accept the app when <i>it</i> wants to and I've tried close to 
					everything to fix this. The app was successfully able to send key presses to a JNetworkServer I threw together on my main computer but by this 
					time it was starting to be more difficult and I was losing patience. I'll revisit this project when either I regain enough patience to deal with 
					the phone again or end up buying/obtaining another slider phone. 
				</p>
				<p>
					All the code I used still works on a regular, modern android phones so it's possible I'll continue the project targeted for those but it wouldn't be 
					a <i>Slide Controller</i>; But at the point I might as well revise the entire thing to be power entirely by JCode - Maybe make Java port.

							I recently bought this laptop as an upgrade from my <i>very</i> slow laptop. The only negative from switching 
							is that I haven't figured out dual booting with it yet. I have Debian installed but without a desktop environment 
							Since the graphics card is Nvidia, and a laptop one at that, debugging graphics has been way harder than it was 
							with AMD. I can still use my Kali live boot if I need to use Linux on it.
