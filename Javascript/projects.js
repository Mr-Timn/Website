					JScene is a cross-platform application engine, writting in C++, using the open source library SDL2 that I originally started as <i>Window.h</i> in my 
					project, Lelantos. It is also the second verion of itself, the first version was originally paired with a game engine but I restructured 
					it with the other parts of the engine in JCode (JRelay/JNumbers) and haven't offically decided to include the game engine with it. 
				</p>
				<p>	
					SDL2 handles most of the low level access and abstraction of devices, peripherals, and general 2D rendering. JScene optimizes SDL2's API to streamline 
					applications across devices. This includes but isn't limited to creating and starting the an application; Updating the screen - frame-by-frame handling;
					Writing text; Keyboard/Touchscreen usage; Drawing and handling images, buttons, text boxes; Audio and video. 
					Updating the new documention hasn't been done yet but you can click <a href="Legacy/JSceneV1Docs/index.html">here</a> and read the documentation for version
					1 of it to get an idea of it; There's a lot missing comparatively but it also includes the game engine I made with it.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Here's a simple example program I made using it below with the relevant code. One is a screen recording from my computer and the other is a video 
					of my Samsung Note 4 running the program; Both stitched into a GIF.

					JRelay is a network application interface written C++ to try and make easier most of the communication when trying to integrate sockets in an application. It has 
					currently 2 parts - JRelayServer and JRelayClient, which when used together it allows for easy setup and use. This includes things like password locked servers 
					to prevent unwanted connections and additional levels of security when attempting communication. Currently it has reverse, caesar, and vignere ciphers functional and 
					can be arranged in many way. I have plans for implementing RSA and Diffie-Hellman for key exchanges and AES for additional security very soon. They'll be implemented 
					once prime number generation is improved in JNumbers. Longer term planning for JRelay would include bluetooth support. 
				</p>
				<p>
					There isn't much else to say about JRelay. Once integration with JNumbers and updated documentation is started the page will start to fill out more. Check 
					out <a onclick="Load_JTransmission()">JTransmission</a> for an application using JRelay. I've detailed most of it's usage there with examples.

					JNumbers is a large number library I created because I was unable to find a sufficent large number library that would work with my future projects 
					in C++. Since speed is a <i>huge</i> part of my goal with this engine it was very important I find something that can be integrated well. This part
					of the enigine still needs a <i>lot</i> of work. At the time of writing, JNumbers does work for infinitely long numbers in a resonable amount of time. 
					Like most programe it's perfromance depends a lot on the speed of your CPU. It can perform the arithmetic operations of addition, subtraction, 
					multiplication, division, modulus, power, and modular exponentiation.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some of the operations in JNumbers aren't optimized completly yet. All individual operations work fast enough for individual problems but isn't good 
					with generating prime numbers over around 32-bits; I have plans to address this very soon as the rest of the engine reaches it's functionality. I have 
					Karatsuba's implemented algorithm is alongside regular multiplication without any benchmarks yet; For the same reason that this 
					project is still in very early development, around a month or so old.

						Here are are results from an example program and the screenshot they come from. The hexadecimal value is passed for calculation since it's the 
						quickest to convert to a usable value. It would be fairly annoying to check the results by hand so if you want to verify you can go 
						<a href="https://defuse.ca/big-number-calculator.htm">here</a>. I used a few websites to verify myself but this one was my favorite.

			<p>
				As the name implies this project is Snake - but made using JCode as the engine. It's the first game that I've made using it. The app is just regular Snake but I added 2 features. 
				The first feature is custom colors; In the settings you can choose the colors for the color of the app's background, the text, the game's background, and the snake. The color for each 
				can be changed with a HSL color picker I implemented. I got the idea 
				for this from my girlfriend which is why I chose this as the first game application for JCode. The second feature is multiplayer; This feature is only really usable on PC because 
				neworking/threading doesn't function as well on android using JRelay with large sets of communication; At least with my Samsung Note 4 dispite using mostly poll based sockets. As 
				far as functionality with multiplayer goes, I was able to play a game on localhost running both clients. What does work on PC <i>and</i> mobile I game scanning - Since the app isn't run on a  
				server connecting to each other is done over LAN, so if someone is hosting a game on your network the app will scan for it. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I don't have any plans for updates in the future. I do plan on releasing it on the Google Play Store and App Store with multiplayer disabled right after I finish and host this website. I'll 
				update this page once I do.

					RPS Simulator is my favorite application that I've programmed so far! It's a simulation that spawns an equal number of rock, paper, and scissors in random positions 
					that actively seek eath other out. When they collide the losing object (like in regular RPS) turns into the losing one. 
					All credits for the core idea of this app go to <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@livingrps/video/6930019547961412869">this</a> TikTok. 
					The app needs to be optimized a lot but it works very well for casual usage. I plan to add a few more features to the app like 
					<a href="https://bigbangtheory.fandom.com/wiki/Rock,_Paper,_Scissors,_Lizard,_Spock">rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock</a> or 
					custom simulation conditions. Sometimes it, or at least it did at one point, results in an actual winner at larger values. My computer could handle team sizes of in the 
					hundreds of thousands but as since it's unoptimized it <i>struggles</i> to produce a winner even at values 800 or so due to the screen bounds causing more overlap.
				</p>
				<p>
					Just like my other programs, here are some screen caps and videos of the app running on my computer. Fun Fact! Since this app doesn't use anything for filesystems to store
					settings or anything of that matter <sup>yet</sup>, the code is <i>technically</i> closer to its respective app than Snake is; A difference of around 5 compared to about 
					10 lines.

				<p>
					New Terra Imperia is a C++ powered version of <a href="Legacy/TerraImperia1/index.html">this</a> poorly organized 2D web application I made in high school; First called 
					<i>Sprite Fight</i> then later called <i>Terria Imperia</i>. I improved the structure of it with an <a href="Legacy/TerraImperia2/index.html">updated</a> version where 
					I at least attemped to provide templates for the objects in it. The HTML versions are essentially the same as the C++ since updates stopped very early on, so checking those 
					out are about the same. I am fairly proud of myself for the combo system that exists in the updated version; You can see the players combos by pressing the escape key. 
					Somewhere in the code exists a really simple disabled AI but it's an old project that I don't have much interest in fixing anything anytime soon. If you check either of 
					them out, the only functional part of it is Versus => PvP. Player 1 used wasd to control and F/G keys as A/B buttons, Player 2 uses the arrow keys for control and K/L 
					for A/B buttons. Press the return key to start the game. I also created a NodeJS version of it that was as semi-functional as the normal pages which will probably also 
					not see any revisions in the future due to it's age.

					three times to switch between operating systems. I managed to get PolyInput ~90% working (input was finicky infrequently) but I ended up switching 
					to using Debian only so I put the project on hold. Since then I've replaced my motherboard and hard drives so I can't provide any videos of the

					Aura is an AI that I made to perform tasks for me on my computer using my voice on Windows. By the time I finished Aura the commands themselves worked fairly

					should. Recompiling Aura so I could take a video was fairly difficult but everything worked well enough to demonstrate. The only command that didn't work 100% 
					was clicking links on a page; The tool and the code I used to pick links on a page ran but refused to open them and I don't want to debug it right now. The 
					other still-functional commands included searching Google/Youtube, selecting windows, videos - fullscreen/pause/play, and locking the computer. I will definitely

					This project I made is <i>very</i> underdeveloped but I'm adding it to the list because it might be relevant with future project of mine. The

					underdeveloped as it is if the phone wasn't running Android 2.1. I easily spent at least 100 hours just getting the application to compile 
					for the phone. Even after creating a template that would work for it, the phone will only accept the app when <i>it</i> wants to and I've tried close to 
					everything to fix this. The app was successfully able to send key presses to a JRelayServer I threw together on my main computer but by this 
					time it was starting to be more difficult and I was losing patience. I'll revisit this project when either I regain enough patience to deal with 
					the phone again or end up buying/obtaining another slider phone.

					All the code I used still works on a regular, modern android phones so it's possible I'll continue the project targeted for those but it wouldn't be
